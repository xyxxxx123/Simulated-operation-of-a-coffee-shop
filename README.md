# Simulated-operation-of-a-coffee-shop
# Virtual Barista ☕

A terminal-based coffee shop simulation game written in Python. This project was developed as part of the COMP9001 final project to demonstrate core programming skills including object-oriented design, input handling, decision logic, and data validation.

## 🎯 Game Description

Step into the role of a virtual barista! Take customer orders, prepare drinks based on recipes, and manage limited inventory. Earn money by serving drinks and reinvest it into purchasing more ingredients. But be careful — if you serve incorrectly or run out of supplies, your shop rating will decrease, and if it hits zero, it's game over!

## 🧩 Features

- Multiple drinks with unique recipes
- Inventory management and restocking with cost control
- Daily simulation loop (play across multiple days)
- Reputation system (start with a rating of 5)
- Strategic decision-making with limited funds and resources

## 🧪 Programming Concepts Used

- Class and Object-Oriented Programming (`Drink`, `Inventory`, `BaristaGame`)
- Conditionals and loops
- Input validation and error handling
- Modular file structure
- Deep copy and rollback logic for safe decision confirmation
